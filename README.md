### Description

We have currently uploaded 6 sample cases of data with different people and diverse motions. Meanwhile, 3 single-frame data have been uploaded as examples, which you can access without signing the license agreement.

To run algorithms on single-frame data, you need to move the calibration files. For `image_white` under instant-ngp format, rename the frame folder to `images` and move `transforms.json` to the same directory as `images`. For `image_white_undistortion` in colmap format, rename the frame folder to `images` and move the `sparse/0` folder to the same directory as `images`.

The overall file structure is as follows:
```
├── image_white
│    ├── %d                - The frame number, starts from 0.
│    │   └──%d.png         - Masked RGB images for each view. view number starts from 0.
│    └── transforms.json   - Camera extrinsics and intrinsics in NGP format.
│
├── image_white_undistortion
│    ├── %d                - The frame number, starts from 0.
│    │   └──%d.png         - Undistorted maksed RGB images for each view. view number starts from 0.
│    └── colmap/sparse/0   - Camera extrinsics and intrinsics in Gaussian Splatting format.
```
